# CuttingEdgeOAjournal
This was a plan until Peer Community In came along. Now this repo is an archive of a conversation and resources for a 100% OA overlay journal on general science (or broader) that only publishes reproducible manuscripts with open, editorial-managed post-publication peer review, CC-BY, selects based on validity (not subjective impact), no APCs, and keeps up with modern publishing by incorporating new open practices as they're invented. Owned/run by NGO and/or the researchers themselves.
